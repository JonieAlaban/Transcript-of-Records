res = sub * unit
GWA = summation of all res / 23




It seems you're on the right track! You're calculating the individual GWAs (Grade Weighted Averages) for each subject. Now, you need to compute the student's total GWA by summing up these individual GWAs and dividing by the total number of units.

Here's your code updated to include the calculation of the total GWA:


def computeGWA(math_grade, sci_grade, fil_grade, eng_grade, thesis_grade, python_grade):
    # Define the weights for each subject
    math_weight = 4
    sci_weight = 3
    fil_weight = 3
    eng_weight = 3
    thesis_weight = 6
    python_weight = 4

    # Calculate the individual GWAs for each subject
    mathGWA = math_grade * math_weight
    sciGWA = sci_grade * sci_weight
    filGWA = fil_grade * fil_weight
    engGWA = eng_grade * eng_weight
    thesisGWA = thesis_grade * thesis_weight
    pythonGWA = python_grade * python_weight

    # Calculate the total units
    total_units = math_weight + sci_weight + fil_weight + eng_weight + thesis_weight + python_weight

    # Calculate the total GWA
    studentGWA = (mathGWA + sciGWA + filGWA + engGWA + thesisGWA + pythonGWA) / total_units

    return studentGWA
